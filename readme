ipstack API query

###Purpose:
This Python script allows you to retrieve the location information for a given IP
address using the IPStack API. It provides latitude and longitude
coordinates for valid IP addresses.

###Potential additions later on:
This API takes in additional values that may be useful and could be added later.  They are currently not being accepted in this version.
The API can also take in bulk IP addresses which could be useful.
HTTPS is also a possibility if needed later.

Security of the API key:
In this program the API key is stored in a separate file that should not generally be checked into a repository, but will be for the sake of this interview.
A separate keyring module, vault (AWS Secrets Manager, Docker Secrets, etc), some other secure location.

###Prerequisites:
Before using this script, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

Python 3.x: You can download and install Python from the official website.
The requests library: You can install it using pip with the following command:
pip install requests

Docker: install the docker plugin for your IDE if using Docker
pip install docker

###Getting Started:
Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
Obtain an API key from IPStack by signing up at https://ipstack.com/. Replace the given test key with your own API key in the config file.

###Usage
To use the script, open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you have the script. Run the following command:

python3 ipstack.py <Valid IP Address>
Replace <Valid IP Address> with the IP address you want to look up.

Examples of usage:
python3 ipstack.py --help
Usage: python3 ipstack.py <Valid IP Address>

python3 ipstack.py 76.111.44.39 asdf
Usage: python3 ipstack.py <Valid IP Address>

python3 ipstack.py 76.111.44.393
API call was unsuccessful. Error: The IP Address supplied is invalid.

python3 ipstack.py 76.111.44.39
The location of the IP address given is: 33.86347961425781, -84.1310806274414


##API Format
// Standard IP Lookup - look up the data behind an IP address
http://api.ipstack.com/134.201.250.155
    ? access_key = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
// optional parameters which are not being handled by this program at this time
// More information can be found at https://ipstack.com/quickstart
    & fields = ip,location,security
    & hostname = 1
    & security = 1
    & language = en
    & callback = MY_CALLBACK
    & output = json

###Error Codes as copied from ipstack.com/documentation
Whenever a requested resource is not available or an API call fails for another reason, a JSON error is returned. Errors always come with an error code and a description.
Example Error: The following error is returned if your monthly API request volume has been exceeded.
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": 104,
    "type": "monthly_limit_reached",

  }
}
